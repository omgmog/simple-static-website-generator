# A simple static website boilerplate

## Featuring

- Twig templating (docs: https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/templates.html)
- JSON data
- Sass for styles


## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install .` in the directory
3. `gulp build` to build everything
4. `gulp watch` to watch the `src/` directory for changes


The `src/` files will be built out to `dist/`. You could use `http-server` to serve the `dist/` directory, or just upload the contents of `dist/` to your web server like some sort of cowboy!
